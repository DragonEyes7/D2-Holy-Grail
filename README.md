# D2-Holy-Grail

This little program main focus is to help you manage easily your inventory on multiple characters, since Diablo has a lot of loot. I wanted an easy way to see the inventory of all my characters at all time. I also wanted to compare what just dropped and what I have to find the perfect version of an item. This program is not made to cheat and no cheat will be accepted, the program doesn't read game Data, it just read text from an image, it's the player work to screenshot (include with the program) an item data to add to the program database.

The UI is the weakest part of the program right now, it's using TKinter.

Feel free to add any changes.

NO CHEAT ALLOWED
